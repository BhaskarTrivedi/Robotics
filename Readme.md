I always facinate and love about robot and wanted to learn robot programming. My thrust towards robot take to explore more about this 
subject and I start coding from building lego robot and pragramming it as my academic project. Here I will share some of my lego robot 
development which i did in my academic as a team project also many more other than just lego in coming future stay tune and fork the 
repository.

**Project**
  1) SimplifiedFootball

  **SimplifiedFootball**<br/>
In this project two team compete each other in simplefied version of football match. Field is divided into three areas. Each team has their own defence area where other team can't come and middle area is as free space. Football match is played by using IR ball and each team is provided IR sensor to detect the ball. Teams are free to use their choice of sensor. Each team compete each other in free space that is middle area of field and try to push IR ball to opponent area such that ball should hit opponet wall.
