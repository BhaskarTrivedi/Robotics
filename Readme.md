I always facinate and love about robot and wanted to learn robot programming. My thrust towards robot take to explore more about this 
subject and I start coding from building lego robot and pragramming it as my academic project. Here I will share some of my lego robot 
development which i did in my academic as a team project also many more other than just lego in coming future stay tune and fork the 
repository.

**Project**
  1) SimplifiedFootball
  2) Search, find and extuigish the fire
  
  **SimplifiedFootball**<br/>
In this project two team compete each other in simplefied version of football match. Field is divided into three areas. Each team has their own defence area where other team can't come and middle area is as free space. Football match is played by using IR ball and each team is provided IR sensor to detect the ball. Teams are free to use their choice of sensor. Each team compete each other in free space that is middle area of field and try to push IR ball to opponent area such that ball should hit opponet wall.

<br/>**Search, find and extuigish the fire**<br/>
Search, find and extuigish the fire This project is design to explore the unknown territory and perform the desire task using autonomous 
robot. Robot will start any of the room which is not know to it before time. It have to explore all map find out the fire source( candle 
light) and extuigish it to remove fire hazard.
